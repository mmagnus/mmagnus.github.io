DESCRIPTION:Next week join us our second RNA CASP SIG meeting with a pre
 sentation from:\n\nDr. Ewan McRae\nRNA origami as a structure prediction
  target and a tool for structural biology\n\nRNA origami are designer RN
 A structures that are programmed\, via their sequence\, to fold co-trans
 criptionally into arbitrary 3D shapes. Although the secondary structure 
 of these sequences poses little challenge to prediction algorithms\, the
 ir relatively long length and large number of tertiary interactions and 
 junctions complicate the prediction of their 3D structure. We have recen
 tly updated the RNA origami design process to improve its throughput and
  characterized numerous RNA origami structures with cryo-EM. Here we wil
 l discuss the similarities and differences between our designs\, the exp
 erimental structures as well as the structural predictions from the CASP
 15 community experiment.\n\nZoom link Tuesday June 20 Pacific Time 8am /
  Eastern Time 11am / Central European Time: 5pm / China Standard Time: 1
 1pm\n\nIf you have recommendations on topics of discussion or speakers\,
  please feel free to email us as well. \n\nSee you!\nRachael Kretsch (Rh
 iju Das and Wah Chiu labs @Stanford)\nMarcin Magnus (Elena Rivas lab @Ha
