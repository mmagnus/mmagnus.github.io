 IO\n\nDr. Frank Dimaio is an Associate Professor at the Institute for Pr
 otein Design. His research is focused on protein structure determination
  from sparse and noisy experimental data. By combining ideas from protei
 n structure prediction with data-guided conformational sampling\, we may
  uniquely determine a protein’s structure to atomic accuracy in cases wh
 ere neither data nor prediction alone is sufficient. The methods Frank h
 as developed include tools for solving difficult molecular replacement p
 roblems\, elucidating more than a dozen structures previously unsolved i
 n the laboratories of expert crystallographers. He has also developed a 
 new approach for low-resolution crystal refinement\; this method outperf
 orms state-of-the-art refinement packages\, making it possible to infer 
 detailed atomic interactions from low-resolution crystal data]. Frank is
  further interested in developing tools for de novo structure determinat
 ion from low-resolution data\, as well as extending these approaches to 
 other sources of data. Additionally\, he is more generally interested in
  structure prediction\, developing methods for improving conformational 
 sampling\, protein forcefield development\, and modeling (and design) of
  symmetric protein assemblies. Improvements to structure prediction – bo
 th sampling methods and forcefields – are critical to designing proteins
  with novel function.\n\nWe aim to meet virtually monthly to discuss the
  state of and new developments in our community. https://groups.google.c
